                BlazBlue: Continuum Shift retains the traditional 2D fighter gameplay of two characters participating in
                a duel on a two dimensional plane. A match can consist of one to five rounds known as "rebels". To win a
                round, one player must either deplete the other one's life gauge to 0 by inflicting enough damage
                through various attacks or by having more remaining health after the round's timer depletes.<br><br>

                <img src="images/news.jpg" alt="Some photo."><br><br>

                During each rebel, players fill a Heat Gauge which can be used for advanced techniques such as
                Distortion Drives, Rapid Cancels, Counter Assaults, and certain characters' attacks (Jin/Hakumen). The
                Heat Gauge can be filled via dealing damage, taking damage, and perfectly blocking attacks. However,
                some mechanics from the previous installment have been changed or completely replaced in the transition.
